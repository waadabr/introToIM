**Here is the description of my hands free switch**

For my switch I used my feet to turn the LED light on. I put two pieces of aluminum foil on the heel of both of my shoes and attached a wire to each foot. Those wires were connected to the board to complete the circuit. When my heels touch The LED light turns on and when they are not touching it stays off. I incorporated some footwork for when my heels touch. This is just a fun move my friends and I used to do when we were kids. Ultimately, the heel touch acted as a switch for the LED light.
