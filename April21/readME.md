**Class Example Experimentation:**

Description:
For this assignment I experimented with an example made by Aaron Sherwood. The original and experimented version pictures are shown below. Some of the things I changed to better understand the code were:
- multiplying the velocity by a larger number in the rotateLine() function. This caused the lines to rotate extremely quickly and then disappear from the screen. I think this is because the lines were moving in different directions and too quickly to make new line connections and so they just disappeared after spinning for a while.
