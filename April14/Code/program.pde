/*Overall Concept & Instructions:
My program loops through a cycle of posters of movies and tv shows. When the user presses 
'enter' the cycle stops and the random poster that is selected corresponds to a
row in the netflix csv file and displays the information for that movie or tv show. 
The user can then press any button and it will return them to the main random selection 
screen for them to make another selection. */
