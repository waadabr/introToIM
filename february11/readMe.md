**Project explanation:**

For this project I was inspired by traffic and police lights. I set 3 buttons: green, yellow and red and 3 LEDs of the same colors. I also had 2 pairs of blue LEDs that would act as "cars" in response to the button pressed. When you press the red button, the red LED turns on and the "car" (blue) LEDs remain off. When you press the yellow button, the yellow LED turns on and the "cars" blink but with a slower delay. When you press the green button, the green LED turns on and the "cars" blink rapidly with a faster delay time. This is supposed to mimic an actual traffic light. 

To create my police light I placed 8 LEDs in a row: 3 red, 2 white, and 3 blue. I coded the program so that different combinations of the LEDs could be turned on in order to look like the siren light of a police car. I had a blue button that controlled when these lights turned on. The outcome was relatively accurate to the real police emergency light.
